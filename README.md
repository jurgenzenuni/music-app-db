🎵 Music Streaming Database Schema
A comprehensive PostgreSQL database schema design for a music streaming platform (Spotify-like), featuring user subscriptions, artist catalogs, playlists, and social features.

📋 Project Overview
This project demonstrates advanced database design concepts including:

Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) modeling

Complex many-to-many relationships with junction tables

Self-referential relationships for social features

Proper normalization and foreign key constraints

Strategic indexing for query optimization

Key Features:

User authentication and subscription management

Artist profiles with albums and tracks

User-created playlists with collaborative options

Listening history tracking for analytics

Social features (follow users and artists)

🗂️ Database Structure
Tables Overview
plans - Subscription tier definitions (free, basic, premium)

users - User account information

subs - Subscription history with lifecycle tracking

artists - Artist profiles and metadata

albums - Album catalog

songs - Track library with duration and genre

playlists - User-created playlists

list_content - Junction table: playlists ↔ songs (many-to-many)

listening_history - User play tracking for analytics

users_follows_users - Junction table: user following (self-referential)

user_follows_artists - Junction table: users ↔ artists (many-to-many)

Relationships
One-to-Many: Users → Playlists, Artists → Albums, Albums → Songs, Plans → Subscriptions

Many-to-Many: Playlists ↔ Songs, Users ↔ Artists, Users ↔ Users (following)

Self-Referential: Users following other users

🛠️ Technologies Used
Database: PostgreSQL

Schema Design: ERD modeling with crow's foot notation

Data Types: SERIAL, INTEGER, TEXT, VARCHAR, MONEY, BOOLEAN, TIMESTAMPTZ, BYTEA

🚀 Getting Started
Prerequisites
PostgreSQL 12 or higher

psql or pgAdmin for database management

Installation
Clone this repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/music-streaming-database-schema.git
cd music-streaming-database-schema
Create a new PostgreSQL database:

bash
createdb music_streaming
Execute the schema:

bash
psql -d music_streaming -f schema.sql
🔍 Design Decisions
Indexing Strategy
Foreign keys are indexed on frequently joined columns:

albums.artist_id - For artist discography queries

songs.artist_id and songs.album_id - For music catalog joins

listening_history.user_id and listening_history.song_id - For analytics queries

Composite Primary Keys
Junction tables use composite primary keys instead of surrogate keys:

Enforces uniqueness at the database level

More efficient storage and query performance

Standard best practice for many-to-many relationships

Subscription History
The subs table creates a new row for each subscription period rather than updating existing records:

Maintains complete audit trail

Enables churn analysis and resubscription tracking

Supports subscription upgrades/downgrades

📝 Example Queries
Get a user's active subscription:

sql
SELECT u.username, p.plan_name, s.expires_at
FROM users u
JOIN subs s ON u.id = s.user_id
JOIN plans p ON s.plan_id = p.plan_id
WHERE u.id = 1 AND s.status = 'active';
Find most played songs:

sql
SELECT s.song_name, a.name as artist, COUNT(*) as play_count
FROM listening_history lh
JOIN songs s ON lh.song_id = s.id
JOIN artists a ON s.artist_id = a.id
GROUP BY s.song_name, a.name
ORDER BY play_count DESC
LIMIT 10;
Get all songs in a playlist:

sql
SELECT s.song_name, a.name as artist, s.length
FROM list_content lc
JOIN songs s ON lc.song_id = s.id
JOIN artists a ON s.artist_id = a.id
WHERE lc.playlist_id = 1
ORDER BY lc.position;
